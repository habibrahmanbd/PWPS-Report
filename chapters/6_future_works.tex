\section{Conclusion}
We introduced \textbf{PWPS}, a new outline method for solving single variable Percentage Word Problems. \textbf{PWPS} converts the problem in such a way that can be solve like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division problem. In \textbf{PWPS}, we followed the way of generating equation trees using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and training local and global model like ALGES, but we changed the way of scoring and that gives more accuracy comparing direct uses of ALGES in converted problem text of percentage word problems.

\section{Future Works}

At present, we have focused on single variable percentage word problems. In near feature, we hope to extend our system for multi-variable percentage word problems. The accuracy of \textbf{PWPS} can be further improved by optimizing the errors. Moreover, this system can be farther expanded to other domains like physics, chemistry and so on. We hope our dataset will help the researcher to expand math word problem solving. Our code and dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/habibrahmanbd/PWPS}.
