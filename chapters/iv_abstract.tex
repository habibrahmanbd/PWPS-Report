	\noindent \textbf{Math word problems} are the mathematical problems
	that are expressed verbally in natural language. Percentage word problem is one of the math word problems related to percentage problems. Percentage word problems involved in our daily life such as interpreting the financial news, predicting sports results or whether update etc. 
	
	
	\noindent Solving Percentage Word Problems is still a big challenge in Natural Language Processing. This paper	presents an approach to solve Percentage Word Problem by parsing into equations. 
	
	\noindent In our system, we have used semantic parsing to generate equation trees with the help of \textbf{Integer Linear Programming (ILP)}. We have trained a local relationship model
	based on the operand and operators in the equations and a global model based on equationsâ€™ correctness. In testing, we have scored the generated equation trees based on a local and global model.
	
	\noindent We have conducted experiments on a test set about 200 problems and our system \textbf{Percentage Word Problem Solver (PWPS)} is able to solve \textbf{69.19\%} of the problems.
