	\noindent Math word problems are the mathematical problems that are expressed verbally in natural language. Percentage word problem is one of the math word problems related to percentage problems. Percentage word problems involved in our daily life such as interpreting the financial news, predicting sports results or whether update etc. Solving Percentage Word Problems is still a big challenge in Natural Language Processing. This paper	presents an approach to solve Percentage Word Problem by parsing into equations. In our system, we have used semantic parsing to generate equation trees with the help of Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We have trained a local relationship model based on the operand and operators in the equations and a global model based on equationsâ€™ correctness. Random Forests Classifier is used to generate maximum likelihood probability of operator from the local relationship model and correctness of the equation from the global equation model.
	
	\noindent We have conducted experiments on a test set about 200 problems and our system Percentage Word Problem Solver (PWPS) is able to solve 69.19\% of the problems.
